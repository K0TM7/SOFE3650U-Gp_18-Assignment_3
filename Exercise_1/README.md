In this exercise, we implemented the mvc pattern as given in the outline. so the model is the cash register , the view is the display and ticket printer, the controller is what the user uses for the scanner, and the user is the display for the user to view the output. the keyboard and scanner is dependent on the cash register as the cash register is dependent on the user, thus creating a loop. acknowledging this information gives us a better understanding as to how to code this sytem and make it so that this cash register will work with ease for the user and the customer.
